BIG-IP LTM Configuration
======================================

In this section we'll see how to configure the |ltm| module so it can proxy all the requests to the AWS API Gateway. It is a little bit different from what we use to do in regular deployments of |ltm|. So even if you have experience with |ltm|, we do recommend that you read all the instructions and all notes carefully, as we explain why we did that specific configuration.

Connect to the Windows JumpHost (RDP) with the credentials provided earlier. The Chrome browser has a bookmark to the BIG-IP, click on it to access the BIG-IP GUI.
