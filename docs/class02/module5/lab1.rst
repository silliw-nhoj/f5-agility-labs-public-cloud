Create a Virtual Server on Big-IP VE the newfangled way
-------------------------------------------------------

In the previous lab, you created a virtual server by walking through a step-by-step **imperative** guide. Alternatively, all of the configuration objects representing an F5 Virtual Server and associated application services can be kept in a single **declarative** JSON file using the Application Services Extension 3.

Open the Application Services 3 Extension Documentation Introduction in a new tab, read the Introduction to familiarize yourself with AS3, and move on to the next task.
