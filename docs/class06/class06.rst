F5 Azure Automation 
===================

Welcome to “F5 Azure Automation” lab. This guide is intended to complement
lecture material provided by “F5 Azure Automation” course. This course 
is run using Gitub, Ansible, Docker, and the Azure portal. 

For lab purposes, F5 utilizes a jump host which is a Linux system loaded with 
Ansible and Docker. 

This lab is to demonstrate how F5 technologies can integrate with
the Azure cloud infrastructure. Lab 1 uses a manual process to build an
application environment. Labs 2 and 3 use ansible to automate the entire process.
